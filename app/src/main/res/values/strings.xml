    <string name="about_text">For our concluding Indigenous Futures: Decolonizing NYC -- Documenting the Lenape Trail seminar project, we propose to focus our attention to a larger scale project of reestablishing collective memory of the Lenape homeland, Manahahtaan - through a collection of artwork, events, non-linear narratives, activism, interactive maps, and conversations. Upon navigating conversations that will concern not just Lenape, but indigenous futurities within the context of Manahahtaan; within the context of this group\'s varying understandings of indigenous\' realities and experiences, the crux of this project attempts to be very intersectional, collective and exploratory. Our individual and collective research take on this same approach by outlining a type of de-colonial effort that probes, meditates on, and experiments with how our identities and backgrounds motivate our collective imaginings of indigenous people\'s past, present, and future. With our work paying homage to the first people of Manahahtaan Island, our collective intent is to honor their longstanding presence, contributions and history on this land. Foremost, we would like to point out that this project does not and will not serve as an authority in Lenape Cultural re-memories. Instead this project helps us carve out imaginative, artistic, and physical platforms in how we re-imagine and engage with Indigenous histories, futures, and realities as outsiders. In this sense, as both visitors on their island and outsiders to their cultural historiographies, we are continually reminded of the limitations of our work in representing and articulating lived indigenous realities. In an effort to best honor indigenous communities, our work remains under the guidance of Lenape and indigenous cultural bearers, who have helped us along the way, sifted through our queries and varying abstractions of Lenape futurities. As colonial and imperialist perspectives and intentions continue to be present, we recognize the importance of aligning our work with indigenous issues and realities, which  include: Afro-Diasporic spatial relations, the New York State Pilgrim Pipeline, as well as similarly overlooked ecological/indigenous disputes surrounding Standing Rock, Mauna Kea, and the Sacramento River (Salmon run). Additionally we hope to ensure that our collective group efforts should not and will not stand as a "palatable" replacement to indigenous historiographies; rather we believe everyone should make strides in actively learning and decolonizing their approaches in re-imagining Lenape and indigenous futures. Lastly, while our collective project continues to unfurl into an intentional educational apparatus of disruption- meant to call out and parade colonialism\'s ravenous presence on Lenape\'s historiographies and claim to futurity- we find ourselves facing various disruptions as we work through and grapple with how our individual identities and cultures could re-animate different indigenous futures. For right now viewers could witness these unfolding questions, reflections and constraints by tracking our geographic mapping and cartography of a de-colonial Lenapehoking - Manahahtaan. Each point on this map speaks to our individual and collective re-memory and understanding as it relates to Lenape and indigenous environments, waterways, plants, animals, land, mobility, and temporality. We hope this project will propel others to create more collaborative dreaming spaces that work to decolonize, re-imagine, and re-animate alternate futures for indigenous and marginalized folks.
