           \t For our concluding Indigenous Futures: Decolonizing NYC -- Documenting the Lenape Trail seminar project, we propose to focus our attention to a larger scale project of reestablishing collective memory of the Lenape homeland, Manahahtaan - through a collection of artwork, events, non-linear narratives, activism, interactive maps, and conversations. Upon navigating conversations that will concern not just Lenape, but indigenous futurities within the context of Manahahtaan; within the context of this group\'s varying understandings of indigenous\' realities and experiences, the crux of this project attempts to be very intersectional, collective and exploratory. Our individual and collective research take on this same approach by outlining a type of de-colonial effort that probes, meditates on, and experiments with how our identities and backgrounds motivate our collective imaginings of indigenous people\'s past, present, and future.
            \n\n
            \tWith our work paying homage to the first people of Manahahtaan Island, our collective intent is to honor their longstanding presence, contributions and history on this land. Foremost, we would like to point out that this project does not and will not serve as an authority in Lenape Cultural re-memories. Instead this project helps us carve out imaginative, artistic, and physical platforms in how we re-imagine and engage with Indigenous histories, futures, and realities as outsiders. In this sense, as both visitors on their island and outsiders to their cultural historiographies, we are continually reminded of the limitations of our work in representing and articulating lived indigenous realities. In an effort to best honor indigenous communities, our work remains under the guidance of Lenape and indigenous cultural bearers, who have helped us along the way, sifted through our queries and varying abstractions of Lenape futurities.
            \n\n
            \tAs colonial and imperialist perspectives and intentions continue to be present, we recognize the importance of aligning our work with indigenous issues and realities, which  include: Afro-Diasporic spatial relations, the New York State Pilgrim Pipeline, as well as similarly overlooked ecological/indigenous disputes surrounding Standing Rock, Mauna Kea, and the Sacramento River (Salmon run). Additionally we hope to ensure that our collective group efforts should not and will not stand as a "palatable" replacement to indigenous historiographies; rather we believe everyone should make strides in actively learning and decolonizing their approaches in re-imagining Lenape and indigenous futures.
            \n\n
            \tLastly, while our collective project continues to unfurl into an intentional educational apparatus of disruption- meant to call out and parade colonialism\'s ravenous presence on Lenape\'s historiographies and claim to futurity- we find ourselves facing various disruptions as we work through and grapple with how our individual identities and cultures could re-animate different indigenous futures. For right now viewers could witness these unfolding questions, reflections and constraints by tracking our geographic mapping and cartography of a de-colonial Lenapehoking - Manahahtaan. Each point on this map speaks to our individual and collective re-memory and understanding as it relates to Lenape and indigenous environments, waterways, plants, animals, land, mobility, and temporality. We hope this project will propel others to create more collaborative dreaming spaces that work to decolonize, re-imagine, and re-animate alternate futures for indigenous and marginalized folks.

    \tI\'m Jane, a junior at Gallatin studying computer science and urban planning - I\'m interested in different ways software can be used to make cities more sustainable and inclusive- places where people feel respected, happy, and safe. I love working with different kinds of technology and want to program our class website in a way that represents Lenape culture, spiritualities, and knowledges in a meaningful way. Being part of the generation that lives in the \"information age,\" we should use all the data and tools that we can access to communicate and tackle some of the ongoing issues that our society and environment are facing. I learned a valuable lesson about how to develop tech that addresses societal issues during my previous semester when I studied abroad in the United Arab Emirates and participated in the "Smart Cities for Women: Dubai" hackathon. I was part of a team that initiated a platform for giving women and expatriates a greater voice in the Dubai government. Through my experience, I realized that, understanding and listening to the stakeholders is the greatest asset in developing a successful, meaningful application. \n\n

    \tAs a Korean immigrant who gained American citizenship through her parents, I have been raised with privilege and spent most of my life not being aware of it. Learning more about Lenape history has made me uncomfortable and also grateful; I am living on Lenape grounds, and I had never recognized it before this semester. I consider my father and his business in New York quite successful; however, I also have to acknowledge that his store is not just an indicator of his hard work but an opportunity that has been given through capitalism and colonization. Children of immigrants are usually told not to forget where they are from; rarely are they asked to question the whereabouts of the native people of the land that they are residing in. Through this project, I want to encourage more families of immigrants to acknowledge this discomfort and think more about decolonizing their experiences- to think not just about their heritage but also of the history of the land that they migrated to.\n\n

    \tThe first phase of the research that I\'m doing for our project is centered around plants that the Lenape used for medicinal purposes. The question I wanted to tackle was how cultures have used both herbal remedies and pharmaceutical drugs. Growing up, whenever I got sick my mom was always quick to hand me whatever cough syrup we had in our cabinet. However, my parents also exposed me to alternative medicines and therapies such as acupuncture, cupping, and chiropractic. \n\n

    \tInspired by my exposure to these different kinds of medicines, I created a storybook connecting stories of a New York City pharmacist and a Lenape healer. The book has two "beginnings" on each side of the book, and the "endings" converge in the middle. On one end of the book, the Lenape healer, who was chosen by her community for her spiritual connection and knowledge of plants, goes on a search to find the items in need when her friend\'s baby was sick. After praying, she finds the American elderberry (sambucus canadensis), a beautiful flower that she takes back to her village and brews. On the other side of the book, the main character is a pharmacist working in one of the many Duane Reade stores in Manhattan. The pharmacist reaches for his customer\'s prescription and goes back in time to the 1970\'s and 1980\'s, where medical researchers have strived to make natural drugs but have given up because they were difficult to duplicate. These drugs have been effective, but are leading us to the end of the "pharmaceutical era," where the medicines we buy are becoming less effective. The pharmacist returns back to the present to read an article about a botanist in Georgia who has been searching for more medicinal plants to combat our use of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n

    \tAfter my research on the relationship between herbal medicine and synthetic drugs, I looked at other plants that the Lenape utilized, and extrapolated upon that research to draw conclusions on the rights of Lenape women and the ecology of parks in New York City. \n\n</string>
