        <description><![CDATA[the original people of this area were able to draw on the resources of the water and the land, but the European colonialist state took a much more aggressive approach to land use, dredging the bay so that large ships could navigate it, allowing New York to become a center of global capitalism. The destructive anthropogenic changes in the structure of the New York Bay caused dramatic changes in its flora and fauna, eradicating many shellfish that were a primary food source for the Lenape. After 400 years of dredging and interference, global climate change has caused large storms like Hurricane Sandy to hit New York, but the destruction of the shallow estuarine environment causes storm surges to hit the city unfiltered by marshes and shoals. Much of the damage to lower Manhattan and other coastal neighborhoods in New York and New Jersey could have been mitigated had we not deepened and built out into the Bay. <br><br>- Chloe]]></description>

This calculation was made for the year 2050, meaning an inundation of this level has a .2% possibility of occurring in the year 2050, but has a full chance of occurring within the next 500 or fewer years. The chances of a flood that is not this severe are much higher, making this a worst case scenario, but these calculations will have to be revised as sealevels rise globally and other factors influence the probability of superstorms hitting New York City. While the city already suffered billions of dollars of damages and mass power outages as a result of Superstorm Sandy, the resources that would be affected by an inundation of the level pictured here include the city's largest wastewater treatment plant at Newtown Creek, the train yards in East New York and Long Island City, and multiple power stations. A good portion of Brooklyn and Queens, with a combined population of about 5 million people, would be debilitated by a flood of this level. <br><br>- Chloe]]></description>

However, due to wastewater and chemical pollution oysters became unsafe to eat in the 1800s and were driven to the brink of extinction in the city's waterways by dredging and overharvesting. This site is one of the few where oyster colonies remain and multiple organizations are working in tandem to help build up their habitat and improve the health of the waterway. These include educational institutions and citizen's groups like Rocking the Boat and public institutions like the NYC Parks Department. Oysters, surf clams, and other shellfish are integral to the health of our waterways, protecting us from pollution and storm surges and supporting diverse ecosystems. Nowadays, nonprofit programs are encouraging restaurants to return used oyster shells to areas like this one to build habitat, but this important balance is something that indigenous peoples like the Lenape already know.

The first image is from 1766 (reprinted 1874), where Red Hook is basically an island, and the second image is from a 1780s map showing fortifications from the Revolutionary War. Many developments, like the Columbia street pier, are visible on this map from 1889, while others, like the Gowanus Bay Terminal, were developed even later. I lived in the Gowanus Bay Terminal, an industrial site where the Gowanus Canal empties out into the bay, for two months. The Gowanus Canal is a Superfund site and is considered highly toxic, and living and working in this area with industrial waste, polluted water, and lead paint caused several health problems for me and my neighbors. <br><br>- Chloe<br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Y-CAiJ5hHdKLa7F6zodwnJbiTk_CoNbsn_n5ZA8Dm3Wjqn8S9GXYvzDNr2DrvRWaSfw4fOMneaF2F0vWbHJb2ddd1NJ8TyXVMwdlxMo7rd0JS0XAXl50N7hkq7I9oNQ5mXG2gPVglSgspr7bVcPjj4txIZZa8kt5xhRylz_hozNwCKIfsjUQ7RXsUmXfvDf36Z8i9SAgN_XcLcNcvFoxYy-2jUPsCwBr4knURK01k1pu" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/lNGMWEJL0hrYciKv4sJfo4ebzc1GlKdV74kRFtEgxjOtFOl-2ip9LtnyPr7RR-atFIoXcfJZJCUKLNaje3527paVhtt7F3aeIdMU89XW_Hv5QNmEuhe9iU-z_TJ82VIYcZnmhw9mj8KMg07FZgrDpyclqqoAO4y6aQjqtFrKRHG96LBZd9ilstepY0szJgzwe5acF-qmouuHJI310aJKeXemXhse8hH4V8hIBuRW" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/sSUZthg1BkBA_gvI_KblQT3crRgXx9W_E2mCB8DZmNgNO9aqNZuNSFXlvjcHqhJ-MZSxfWVh8iQSDGYjUvPpvr7dZDx3j-C_TR1HOaRTpdoxM1WDpDRzHcMl7939sMs9h2bqd3dsV6YlLy0f3OtZnbQMZHOQjWl90eFRnU5piLlonl8fyhX2c1Pb69X1r3kJvRa-zH1Cb3ywZUmDV8FSAeQXp_k9CMlU2Q9PcgdzQNM" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

One of the civilizations one can build is the Iroquois, or more properly the Haudenosaunee.

I did a bit of research through The Welikia Project and other sources and found out that this spot was part of the river just 400 years ago. That had me thinking about what I spent my time in that area doing vs. what people did 400 years ago before the colonists came. I spent my time playing video games at home and bonding with friends over video games. However, 400 years ago, this was part of the river, so it was a large fishing spot for the Lenape. It had me imagining what kinds of games they played with the resources they had and the setting they were in. While their setting was lush and full of life, mine was highly populated and very grey. Many of the resources they had do not exist in that spot today and vice versa, so it has me thinking about the impact setting has on games played.]]></description>

The game requires a few players, the resources to create a hoop and spear, and a setting that allows for a hoop to be in motion. The player throws a spear through a moving hoop and whoever stops the hoop by throwing the spear within the perimeter of the hoop wins the game. I'd like to think the Inwood Hill Park would be a good location for this game, because there is plenty of open space. Not to mention, this was a popular trading (and fishing) spot for the Lenapehoking and other groups they were in contact with. I'd like to think they played this game with other nations. Similar games exist throughout Native groups in the Americas, such as "Chunkey" or "Chunkee" in the Cherokee Nation. Chunkey is similar, in that there is always a hoop to be rolled and always a spear to be thrown, but the independent variables are how long the hoops are rolled for and how the winner is determined.  https://centerofthewest.org/2014/06/14/treasures-plains-indian-game-hoop-arrows/                 http://www.cherokee.org/AboutTheNation/Culture/General/Chunkey.aspx<br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/QvimuJEGu8JmWVTltNHR-jYVlSzvAD1Y15k5Lojfln5-XyHuZEUlzD7dl4INNCrVyVCuQldlH_V9oCX79p7Te6fvv41tisTzLe3Hnq_dj-1Lto5Szrs-l0-T3DWLPY8u_SrUsUsdWrBw2jNI_k1S0ngWesHWWumiO0Sj3hidH69r_tTRLNGEFkRo5mol9rtHHAeyXiq-wT_QCfsJYzYjwc1y8O1R1KkJXER6qyJUoag" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Hudson Canyon is the largest canyon off the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. and one of the largest submarine canyons in the world. The grand scale and diverse structure of the Canyon make it an ecological hotspot for a vast array of marine wildlife including deep sea corals, sharks and other fish, whales, turtles, and seabirds. <br><br>The Canyon directly supports the local economy: these productive waters and habitats are essential to this marine wildlife, as well as the fish and invertebrates that our commercial and recreational fisheries depend on. It is also important to recreational divers, the tourism industry, shipping, and deep sea cables, which are critical for connecting New York and New Jersey to the rest of the world. <br><br>Activists are trying to protect the Canyon and its resources for future generations, and to permanently protect against it oil, gas, and mineral exploration and extraction by nominating it as a National Marine Sanctuary.

The occupation was a continuation of the red power actions being taken across the country, in places like Alcatraz and Wounded Knee. The activists' boat malfunctioned and they never reached the island, but their attempt prompted the Coast Guard to go on alert and patrol the island, anticipating intervention. In a press conference, Shoshone activist John White Fox stated that “There is no place for Indians to assemble and carry on tribal life here in this white man’s city.” Ellis Island was known by indigenous people in the area as Kioshk, Or "Gull Island." Very little is known about this island's history before colonial settlement, and little is known about this reclamation attempt. <br>Who were these activists? How was the action planned, what other work did they do? <br><br>Nigro, Carmen. "Occupying Ellis Island: Protests In the Years Between Immigration Station and National Park." NYPL.

Different communities will be in dialogue through the space, establishing ties between groups that tend to converge around single issues. Moving beyond politics that rely upon loose definitions of commonality, Decolonize This Place seeks instead to mobilize complex differences to decenter whiteness and repatriate land.<br><br>Decolonize This Place will prioritize the presence and work of people of color and will be inclusive of queer, immigrant, and disabled participants—challenging the white supremacy that continues to characterize the economies and institutions of art.<br><br>The project will be grounded in the in-house production of posters, banners, t-shirts and other artworks, with a print station providing the means to make zines and publications. Artworks produced will be displayed in the gallery and strategically used in actions across New York, collapsing a feedback loop between exhibition and demonstration. Through this, 55 Walker Street will be coded as a site of continuous social and aesthetic production that feeds directly into movements across the city. A kitchen and greenhouse will root the project in a politics based on abundance, in an attempt to depart from an economic schema that emphasizes scarcity.<br><br>Just as Artists Space itself is transformed into a self-regulated commons, Decolonize This Place will “strike art” to “liberate art from itself”—in the words of MTL+ member Nitasha Dhillon: “not to end art, but to unleash its powers of direct action and radical imagination.” The fluid intersection between grassroots organizing and creative activism is key to this process. When communities make artworks, and artists become organizers, usual hierarchies of artistic production fall apart. <br><br>Through its three-month duration, Decolonize This Place will question how the alternative arts organization, pressured to justify ever-escalating real estate values, can re-interpret its traditional function as holdout within an art world increasingly quarried for ultra-luxury assets. At a time when so many neighborhoods see art crudely utilized to drive gentrification, what further models of community engagement can nonprofit institutions devise? <br><br>A website with further information, documentation and a calendar of daily activities can be found at www.decolonizethisplace.org.<br><br>#decolonizethisplace<br><br>--Jonathan]]></description>

In 1653 the Dutch began to build a fence, which eventually developed into a 12 foot wall separating the rest of the island from their settlement, which contained farms, businesses, and Fort Amsterdam. The consequences of this structural isolation of groups reach all the way into the present. I see how this city has been built to divide the population into “us” and “them,” to drive others out of the more desirable areas, to justify violence when barriers are threatened.<br><br>Section of Wall Street palisade.

        <description><![CDATA[Before colonial settlement, this was part of the unending expanse of Lenape land. When the Dutch began to build New Amsterdam, this became the northern border of their new town. What had been part of a cycle of cultivation was placed within permanent structures of European development. I’m teaching myself about this history because this land is integral to my life, as it has been for generations of indigenous people. All this leads to more and more questions. Take a look at what I’m questioning, and then keep going on your own. <br><br>-Avi]]></description>

Allen Turner, a black Native American game designer, created Ehdrigohr, which intends to shift the focus away from European concepts and highlight those of Native concepts. This subversive game challenges the norm of mythological games and provides a different play style to role playing games (such as Dungeons and Dragons). I figured a great place to play it would be The Uncommons, a well known coffee / board game shop in the Greenwich Village. On top of this, I think it is important to talk about Native American games as not just games Native Americans played in the pre colonial era, but also as games created by Native Americans, for Native Americans, and including Native American elements. I think to ignore games with Native American influence in contemporary society is a disservice to Native Americans, because it can further perpetuate the notion that Native Americans are in the past. This game, along with many others, ties in with the concept of indigenous futurism and how Indigenous knowledge offers ways of thinking that are overlooked and/or do not exist within prominent spaces of the United States.]]></description>

Little Neck used to be such an important site for harvesting shellfish that the term 'littleneck clam' actually comes from here and has nothing to do with the clam's neck or lack thereof. Alley Pond Park is also home to the 'Alley Pond Giant,' a 300 to 400-year-old tulip tree that is generally considered to be the oldest living thing in New York City.

        <description><![CDATA[New York was once a land locked green space with abundant flora and fauna. Even after Pangea broke apart, Manhattan was still a significant distance away from the Atlantic Ocean. During the last Ice Age, large sheets of ice came down towards current day Manhattan as they melted. With their weight, they carved the deep Hudson River Valley, flooding the area. The area which I concentrate on for this project became a lush marshland surrounded by dense forest.<br><br>	The areas that we now recognize as public parks: Washington Square, Union Square, and Madison Square all followed similar post colonial trajectories. Since they were originally swampland, the land was more challenging to build upon; useless to the colonizers, these areas were quickly transformed into potter’s fields, mass burial sites for the poor. When the inhabitants of the surrounding areas voiced their discontent, these parks were seized by the military and beautified for use as parade grounds, until eventually becoming public parks fairly recently.<br><br>	In my nonlinear walking tour through my mind castle of research, I draw connections between what I associate with the parks today, and deconstruct the symbolism of prominent parts of their landscapes and histories.]]></description>

The forest was home to mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish of all shapes and sizes. The European settlement on Manhattan was still only at the Southern tip of the island, only extending up to the wall of Wall Street, when the Royal Governor of New York declared that this forest could be used as a public hunting ground in 1686. Many of the indigenous species were hunted for sport: bobcats, mountain lions, black bears, grey wolves, bald eagles; others were hunted for their natural beauty: mink, deer, rabbits, beavers, turtles, river otter among many other species. These animals were so insanely pursued that they were all either killed or killed by the destruction of their habitat or migrated West.<br><br>	In 1795, the yellow fever pandemic spread to New York from Philadelphia. According to historical records of Baruch College: "Upon infection, most victims would experience headaches, followed by severe exhaustion, high fever and slowed heart rate. This period was followed by a remission stage and then by delirium. During the delirium stage, victims acquired a characteristic yellow hue on their skin and pupils. In final stages, a vomiting of black bile occurred and was followed by death.” Most of the thousands of New Yorkers who caught it died within a week of infection. Some bodies were later moved to Washington Square Park, but probably that some remain under the current day reflecting pool at the North end of the park.<br><br>In 1807 the park because a Parade Ground which spanned 239 acres from Third Ave to Seventh Ave and 34th Street down to 23rd. The park was later reduced to 89 acres in 1814 when the park was named after James Madison, and again to it’s current size of 6.2 acres in 1944. <br><br>During this phase of the park’s history it hosted four different memorial arches which were all eventually torn down due to public protest. First in 1889 the George Washington arches were commissioned to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his inauguration on Fifth Ave, one on 23rd Street, on at 26th, as well as the one at Washington Square Park. (see Union Square about the direct translation of the word “President” from the Seneca language). The Dewey Arch was constructed to glorify the Admiral’s victory at Manila Bay in 1898. Across 7th Ave, Madison Square Garden was erected and named because it was adjacent to Madison Square Park in 1899. In 1918 after WWI, the Victory Arch in honor of those New Yorkers who died in battle, but was denounced as wasteful of money and effort by the New York Times.<br><br>It is hard to imagine an expanse of land with such vibrant wildlife like this in Manhattan today. Madison Square Park’s biodiversity today depends solely on the neighborhood dogs and the food served at Shake Shack. Doing my research on this park, I decided that the essence of this particular park is waste. The footprint left by the colonizers has been one of disassociation, disrespect, and irresponsibility. Had the indigenous flora and fauna stayed until today Manhattan would be a National Park. The landscape was poisoned by greed, for sport, but also later on to construct large buildings and monumental arches (which were slapped together quickly to the dismay of the neighborhood.<br><br><br>Timeline<br>http://experiencenomad.com/madison-square-park-swamp-gem/<br><br>Arches<br>http://www.boweryboyshistory.com/2015/06/the-arches-of-madison-square-park.html<br>http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/10/13/118163528.html?pageNumber=15<br>http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/03/26/102856293.html?pageNumber=1<br>http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/03/23/98280331.html?pageNumber=23<br>http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9402E0DE1530E132A2575BC0A9669D94689ED7CF<br><br>Flatiron<br>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JkuYRvXM0LY/VnMCxct-whI/AAAAAAAB_hw/-4ZJC-2Rgoc/s1600/Fla]]></description>

Much of the native wildlife were small mammals and birds.<br>	Beavers which were common in Manhattan disappeared when their food supply (maple and aster trees) was decimated to make room for the new order.<br>	The mice in the scene, more specifically Meadow Vole (Microbus pennsylvanicus), would have been one of the most common mammals in the Union Square area pre-1906. They are mainly herbivores, subsisting on foliage, fruits, grains, and occasionally smaller mammals and insects. Their most likely predator in this area are beds of prey such as the Sharp-shinned Hawk in the top left (ADW).<br>	The Sharp-shinned Hawks live in densely forested areas like that of Union Square pre-colonization. They is the smallest hawk in North America. Their diet consists of songbirds and mice (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology).<br>	Union Square Park because it was a marsh, was originally used by the colonists as a communal burial ground for “slaves, paupers, and criminals, and for American prisoners during the Revolutionary War”(NYT) under British rule from the 1750s until 1797 when Washington Square Park was purchased to replace Union Square and Madison Square Parks as a potter’s field.<br>	The statue of George Washington was built in 1856 by Henry Kirke Brown. After George Washington was inaugurated in 1789, he began addressing the “Indian Problem,” not wanting to share the fertile land of New England with the native peoples. One of the tactics he used to force the native people out was by destroying their food reserves. Washington sent troops to torch corn fields from dawn to dusk for months, destroying years of food supply. The Seneca word for President came mean “town destroyer” because Washington showed no mercy to the indigenous peoples. Therefore, I have represented George Washington’s statue surrounded by burning corn, while the other figures peacefully go about their lives.<br><br>	In 1928/29 Union Square was demolished during construction of the subway station below, which now serves as a main transportation hub of the entire city.<br><br>Having lived on Union Square for a short while, I associate the park with the beautiful selection of local fruit and vegetables of the weekly market (although I could have walked around and picked my own 400 years ago). Despite having moved away, I go through that subway frequently.<br><br><br>Union Square Park History. <br><https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park/history>.<br>https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/union-square.htm<br>https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park/monuments/797<br><br>Potter’s Field<br>http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/25/opinion/potter-s-field-aisle-of-the-dead.html<br>http://www.boweryboyshistory.com/2010/10/i-sit-on-your-grave-new-yorks-hidden.html<br><br>Northern red oak<br>https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0778/2679/products/northern_red_oak2_1500.jpg?v=1469160604<br><br>George Washington<br>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Washington_equestrian_statue_Union_Square.jpg<br><br>Beavers<br>http://7wallpapers.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6_Beaver-min.jpg<br>Mice<br>http://animaldiversity.org/site/accounts/information/Microtus_pennsylvanicus.html<br>https://www.google.com/search?q=mice&espv=2&biw=1503&bih=934&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidlvOxqvzQAhVM5IMKHWW0DQwQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=enjlNWPI-JcFEM%3A<br><br>Map<br>https://ephemeralnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/bachmannlithographunionsquare.jpg<br>http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/cso_long_term_control_plan/index.shtml<br><br>View<br>https://about.citymaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/snow.jpg<br><br><br>https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2012/10/<br>http://untappedcities.com/2013/07/12/surprise-what-nyc-former-cemeteries-are-now/<br>http://nypost.com/2014/10/25/the-hidden-cemeteries-of-nyc/<br>https://www.amazon.com/Graveyard-Shift-Family-Historians-Cemeteries/dp/0916489892<br><br><br>Market<br>https://hirosdigitalartgallery.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/1100195.jpg<br><br>Corn F]]></description>

In this piece I decided to represent only carnivorous animals (with the exception in the wood duck which eats bugs occasionally).<br>	Under Dutch rule African born slaves were granted freedom and small plots of land (including present day Washington Square Park) if they guaranteed to give a portion of their crops back to the officers of the trading post. However, the lands were taken from them by the British, and sold to wealthy British and Dutch landowners.<br>	In 1797, the City’s Common Council bought Washington Square Park to transform it into a Potter’s Field and execution area to the dismay of the prominent New York residents (among others Alexander Hamilton). The bodies from Madison Square Park and Union Square Park’s Potter’s Fields were moved to this new location.<br>	In 1826, the park became the Washington Parade Ground, which in turn raised the real estate value of the surrounding area, such as Astor Place, and Lafayette between Astor and 4th Street which became the homes of some of the wealthiest New Yorkers of the time.<br>	The history of protests in the park began with a revolt against NYU’s use of prison labor to construct buildings in the surrounding area in 1834."During the Civil War, racial hatred and fear fueled the draft riots of 1863, the bloodiest urban conflict in American history. Troops summoned from Gettysburg camped out in the Square to ensure peace in the vicinity" (WSPConservancy).<br>	The Washington Square Arch was constructed along with those at Madison Square Park to celebrate the 100th anniversary of George Washington’s inauguration in 1889.<br>	On March 25th, 1911, the workers at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory (current NYU Brown Building) were locked in their work station to insure that they would not leave their posts during work hours. However, a fire broke out and took all 146 lives.<br><br>Washington Square Park History. <https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/washington-square-park/history>.<br>http://washingtonsquareparkconservancy.org/history/<br><br><br>Bolton, Reginald Pelham.

Granny told me recently that it’s strange to see somebody’s pickinaye living on that street now. <br><br>•	I though walking down Fulton Street would get me there faster, but then I realized I did the measurements all-wrong in my head. This time I went back an added two more cups of all-purpose flour, hoping that now I could trace my steps. <br><br>•	I wonder wound there be any sign of you all when I get there. I imagine our encounter tasting, like granny’s spice cake. Often I wonder why it takes so long for her to make it, but recently when I ask her why she said “gyal hush yah mouth and pass me that nutmeg.”<br><br>•	Once nutmeg was added, this meant I was nearing Flushing Avenue. I kept to the right so I would not get lost. <br><br>•	By the time I reached Kent Avenue, her greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pan was already in the oven. I wonder who hunted near these waterways. From where I am standing I could see Manhattaan. The Williamsburg Bridge took me into Lower Manhattaan and by then you used a toothpick to poke at the cake. <br><br>•	I hummed in excitement as the cake was out the oven to cool. Soon I approached Minetta Street, seeing no picknaye in sight.]]></description>

When I am in need of you, I envision granny plopping fitters into her cast iron skillet. She taught me to think of my journeys to you in the context of food. She knows her grand dawta too well. Lateness follows me as I move through this Western space-time continuum, but only time through food remind me of her – my – our temporality. <br><br>•	When you cross Atlantic Avenue you should be pouring the milk into the batter and this time don’t forget the bitters <br><br>•	By the time you reach Bergen Street carefully turn the heat to medium. Then run to the bathroom to quickly pee, making sure to come back in time the fitters burn. <br><br>•	Now you are at the middle of the block, She finally places each fitter on the paper towels, eyeing now again as the oil drain, drain away. <br><br>•	I think the tour lady said something about the settlement houses facing an old Lenape Road. And now you marvel at how it takes to walk here, even though you got here with food on your mind. <br><br>•	Yum, granny the fritters taste sweet nuh …but did the lady in the caramel colored dress have to tell that this place cost $3,000 to rent <br><br>•	I heard a Black co-operative once exist here; you know, one of those type of places that feed and care for Black folks, like what my granny does for me. It was mostly made up of freed African slaves. Probably they ate fritters, like how granny and me do.]]></description>

The rock itself stands in a triangular patch of land between I-95 and the Hutchinson River Parkway. <br><br>If you are interested in visiting, the most common route involves entering Pelham Bay Park by Beach Tree Lane in Pelham Manor, taking a right, then walking along the path (which circumvents the Pelham Bay / Split Rock Golf Course) until you reach an intersection of I-95 and the Hutch. You will have to run across a brief, one lane stretch of an I-95 exit to interact with Split Rock directly.

I think the fact that it commemorates the Siwanoy peoples who once inhabited the land it occupies is extremely notable, especially since so many more key aspects of the town (the Hutchinson River Parkway, Hutchinson Elementary School) stand to commemorate a woman who was murdered by the Siwanoy. <br><br>Though it is undeniably an act of tokenization / self-congratulatory commemoration of the people whose land the school sits atop, it still feels somewhat radical that the school is named “Siwanoy” amidst all of the regional hagiography of Anne Hutchinson. Though Hutchinson was a prominent figure in religious and critical thought, the naming of a parkway, river, and elementary school in her name seemingly pushes an “enlightened white woman murdered by savage natives” narrative.<br><br>While the Siwanoy did mistake Hutchinson for a Dutch Colonist (she was actually English) when attacking her, she still was living on land that was brutally stolen from the area’s indigenous population. Because of this, it is problematic that the town valorizes her as some sort of colonial martyr without giving due credit to the rightful owners of the town’s land.<br><br>http://historicpelham.blogspot.com/2005/03/split-rock-pelham-landmark-for.html<br><br>--Jonathan]]></description>

The education takes a lot of ideas from Native knowledge and teaches much about certain Native cultures and histories. This is an example of how indigenous futurism can be a powerful tool in education and be a valid and respected form of media. I had trouble deciding whether I should put this spot at NYU or I should put it at a children's school, but I ultimately decided at NYU Silver, because I think it is an underrepresented form of knowledge (as NYU does not have an indigenous/Native studies department - In addition to the ahistoricism of Native Americans in American education). I think we could also learn a lot from unfamiliar ways of knowing.<br>http://www.7generationgames.com/]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[I’ve found myself peripherally engaging with Julia Parker, a Coast Miwok-Kashaya Pomo basket weaver. Parker is one of the most prominent indigenous basket weavers in the world, with her baskets featured in a variety of museums around the world. At 89 years old, she sits in Yosemite Valley and teaches visitors about her life; growing up an Indian, being sent to a Native American boarding school, marrying the last full-blood Mono Lake Paiute, and engaging with the public about her heritage. I met Julia when I was a baby and my mother wove baskets under her instructions. I was young and playing in the dirt, harvesting acorns and building structures, while the women around me chatted about their weaving.<br>“Listen to the baskets sing,” was a common phrase. That is how one knows the basket is being woven expertly. <br>Parker often spoke about her time in boarding school, where children were completely immersed in the European-American culture, in language, appearance, and experience. This was in the pursuit of “civilizing the savages,” and this mentality lingers today, as society tends to view indigenous people as artifacts rather than relevant living beings today. The effects of the Indian Schools are still felt in such severe cultural disintegration amongst indigenous groups.]]></description>

It is one of the many plants that the Lenape used to cure the common cold. The Lenape's medicinal uses for plants such as the Ulmus Americana was deeply tied to their spiritual connection to the plants. Today, the American elm is popular throughout cities because of its tolerance to urban conditions- the trees continue to grow upward as long as they are healthy. The tree's flexibility to the urban environment may be why it is so popular in New York City. Urban green spaces have been extremely beneficial for people's health and happiness. People who walk by parks are more likely to be happier and get more exercise. People enjoy spending time in parks and having a break from the urban chaos; however, many citizens would rather parks not to look too "wild" or resemble forests too much. In addition, making paths, planting only a few variations within the park, and preventing animals from living in the park can actually destroy the flora and fauna that is supposed to be there. Thus, because the American elm has been resilient in urban settings, they have been frequently planted in parks as well.  http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/vh/specimen_details.php?irn=2355848]]></description>

The bark scrapings were used as sores, and the leaves could be used for jaundice. In addition, the flowers could help children's colic. Usually one person in a tribe, someone who has deep knowledge of the plants, was designated as the healer. This healer would usually perform a a short ritual before attending to someone who is sick. I created a short storybook connecting the history of pharmaceutical drugs and indigenous medicine- how did American society transition from herbal medicine to having Duane Reade's and CVS's in every street? The book is composed of my drawings and performed with oral storytelling. The reader would discover that before the 1970's, scientists attempted to replicate nature to make medicine. When the chemical compounds became too hard to duplicate, the chemists looked toward synthetic drug development to make medicine, leading us to the end of the "pharmaceutical era", where the drugs from the synthesis can no longer support us in fighting illnesses. Thus, botanists and researchers have been looking toward indigenous plants to find medical solutions for the next generation. On the other side of the book, a Lenape healer searches for the perfect plant to help her friend's sick baby. After a short prayer, nature helps her find exactly what she needs - the American elderberry plant. After boiling the flower petals and delivering the tea to her friend, the baby calms down and stops crying. The healer then returns to the elderberry and gives her thanks to the spot where she took the medicine.  http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/vh/specimen_details.php?irn=2643392<br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/cglwFq9Hu5la9Z2Q_MDIPknbH4a3UwU-fcDeNill4GlLeA93Wnk2e4hRga6iDsm17MLMIE6QrEngFL2Q9pNXj_mTbRzg_xLajV6ZFzTwqVpsqoEUzewF-EeAV9oOt_0wmc28LvcAvMUPDkMyEMbj6zoTZc_s67RotKo7zTWlKVBG4Gp54OD9bxY3M5xBYo6D41didWb9Akx3FI1uJiadNPvlkANFGlFtqmG_rLC9" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/HvBcUX9gMrbdyPD4LTONCPfoO2pT_euuFUAoPkDrewE93ku3SAhTqK1OLyHec7_07N1zBrT2ujGbQPjR4msZifs1ZX_2Ab60E6RrLiMKW04N5OpRr6bUTkmjq_W2WDWp4Fm7d6zlsxmC5v4HaNu0vKeUGc6Orqx07Xuj1HFy1gZSHyWCHf0qsI_eGXk6TcSQGfsnl10UwjpoASjarNUagT3wqxALZIVYccjFmW_TcJE" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/6Wyc8Gw9uKMKjWeDH6xSRXH0yaUXtMgCw8tdwGzss49wZpPdkVW2J6_N0vFEHWLkiVQz90X1vI5m5Uik-JkdbFCGSK3n_bTkL4H89clNQ2Be49UT-crMh6tAKwbKMt8QxZQ85b7vmpqIWSlz3FBV9KhstK9UD95ponZgfvLB60GfqCDNQU9rfEok-06J1bitXEepuJThJMms-Brb5wda7XeRr9lszcXyFcoMxEAOCe8" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/9kmdQ_hds5xA2oA8tzGtqArL_E5I58fFkROHOMaWk3KNnKQEP-nMaR8Or7kxyJVTrCkXwEmD6kDd3uzH8Zq-TdUkiOphUVTudJhHABRzyiHVfYJHBGYBecDcr89gX2YhTv1QvidzsRYcZtbl06gwy4AsPY8UsvUwaacO1DcnEwb7Jvu6QyJOqecucscKZ4pzaCMkl-NzqLTcKVshtGFefctAV6UbuOhkA51KRTcjQa0" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>

Although discourse on the indigenous use of herbs for abortions is rare, people have used plants to terminate pregnancies throughout history. Today, natural abortions are heavily frowned upon by the medical community. However, some women prefer herbal abortions to be closer to nature, or because of the high costs of an abortion. Indigenous women in the US have limited access to surgical abortions. Their birth rights are regulated by the IHS, the Indian Health Service. The IHS "serves all members of federally recognized Native<br>American tribes and their descendants, and it is their principal healthcare provider and<br>health advocate." However, in 1996, a memorandum was declared so that native women can only have an abortion if it saves their lives, or if the pregnancy was due to an act of rape or incest. This prevents many indigenous women in need from getting a medical abortion.  http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/vh/specimen_details.php?irn=2643366  https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2y1qghNDdBoC&oi=fnd&pg=PP9&dq=abortion+history+herb&ots=7t1LWJoqYn&sig=Q3rqWKFHH_XG2wbppt0Iq-Q5aFc#v=onepage&q=abortion%20history%20herb&f=false http://andigracewrites.com/2015/11/herbal-abortions-questions-concerns-and-clarity/ https://www.prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/indigenous_women.pdf https://mic.com/articles/128589/women-are-learning-about-herbal-abortion-online-here-s-why-that-s-a-problem#.VVwXeoh4D]]></description>

It is called Maumun'dl. There are twelve bones, one side of the bone colored white and the other side colored any other color, they are thrown in the air from a bowl and when they are caught, however many pieces have the white side facing up are how many winnings are counted. Generally this game was bet on. I think I would include Tompkins Square Park in this, because all the items needed for this game could be found there. On top of that, I find it to be a park where people can hang out and communicate with each other. To me, it is a good place to play games, as I've done it before and have spent a lot of time in. Not to mention, I see a lot of people playing games and betting on them, so I think it is a proper setting. https://archive.org/stream/gamesofnorthamer00culirich#page/70/mode/2up]]></description>
